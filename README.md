# myWeatherApp
This is a weather app I created using the python based framework called Django. This app provides the weather for any citiy searched by the user. 
This weather data provided to users is fetched from an open source API provided by openweathermap.org. 
If you are interested in running this code, please sign up to openweathermap.org, and then you will receive a personal API key that you can use to put it
in the API_KEY variable of my code in the views.py file.
